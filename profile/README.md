## The ArcticOS Project
ArcticOS wants to empower the future of Operating Systems. Escaping the wild west of the Linux landscape and getting rid of your ties to the corporate Microsoft Windows.

We at ArcticOS aspire to bring you the best possible experience:
- Impecable customisation
- Free and Open Source
- Supports Windows + Linux apps, games and drivers
- ArcticOS Native apps with great and exciting features
- Great security

And no, we are not a Linux distribution, in fact, we got our own kernel named ArcKRNL and own Window Manager, Compositor and Desktop Environment powered by ArcMGR.

We hope you will be excited for this glowing future of computing, because we sure are.
