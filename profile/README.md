> Thanks for everything, this project has taught me a ton over the years but it's time for me to move on.
> I've begun a different project that I am far more excited in and this one has just drained me far past what I'd like to admit so may it rest in peace.  
> You taught me a lot my old man, you were there when my software engineering career properly begun, but unfortunately, you won't be there anymore for the journey that may come going forward.  
> You were like a child to me, thanks. And thanks to all the friends I made through this project. I appreciate all of you.

These are just random experiments or thinks we might've made in the past, not garuanteed for further software support or assistance.

- Pteroly Wrapper - a feature-rich API wrapper around Pterodactyl to make development easier

### Our mission
> I don't want to be the ordinary corporation we all know, but something not interested in high profits or stakeholders tearing apart the userbase.<br>
> We go above and beyond for our users, not the other way around.
